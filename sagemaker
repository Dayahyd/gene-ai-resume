Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed cloud machine learning (ML) platform offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides a comprehensive set of tools and services designed to simplify and accelerate the entire ML lifecycle, from data preparation and model building to training, deployment, and management.
Key features and capabilities of Amazon SageMaker include:
SageMaker Studio: An integrated development environment (IDE) for ML, offering a unified interface for data exploration, model development, training, and deployment. It supports various tools and frameworks, including Jupyter notebooks, and allows for collaborative work.
Data Preparation: Tools for data labeling, feature engineering, and data transformation to prepare datasets for ML model training.
Model Building and Training: Support for various ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet, as well as built-in algorithms. It enables distributed training on scalable infrastructure and offers features like automatic model tuning (hyperparameter optimization).
Model Deployment and Management: Capabilities for deploying trained models into production-ready hosted environments, including options for real-time inference and batch transformations. It also provides tools for monitoring model performance and managing model versions.
SageMaker JumpStart: A library of pre-built solutions, including pre-trained models and notebooks, for common ML use cases, allowing users to get started quickly.
Integration with other AWS services: Seamless integration with other AWS services like Amazon S3 for data storage, AWS Glue for data cataloging and ETL, Amazon Redshift for data warehousing, and more.
Generative AI capabilities: Includes features and tools to support the development and deployment of generative AI models, such as integration with AWS Trainium and SageMaker HyperPod for large-scale training.
